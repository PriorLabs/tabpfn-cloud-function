| Edge Cases                   | ✅ PASS | Handled empty, long, and special inputs    |
| **Overall Test Status**      | ✅ PASS |                                           |

## Test Details

### Model Initialization Test
- Successfully initialized the TabPFN predictor with mock data
- No errors during initialization
- Initialization time: < 0.01 seconds

### Basic Transaction Processing Test
- Successfully processed 5 transactions from test data
- All transactions received predictions
- Categories assigned: Transport, Alimentation, Loisirs, Santé
- Confidence levels: ~95% (mock data)
- No errors encountered

### Extended Transaction Processing Test
- Successfully processed 10 transactions
- Processing time remained fast (< 0.01 seconds)
- Categories consistently assigned
- No errors encountered with larger transaction set

### Edge Case Tests
- Successfully handled the following edge cases:
  - Empty transaction descriptions
  - Very long transaction descriptions (100+ characters)
  - NULL values for transaction descriptions
  - Numeric-only descriptions
  - Special characters and Unicode text
- All edge cases received predictions without errors

## Observed Behavior

The TabPFN Cloud Function correctly:
1. Loads environment variables
2. Initializes the predictor model
3. Processes transaction data in expected format
4. Returns predictions with categories and confidence scores
5. Handles various edge cases gracefully
6. Provides clear error information when needed

## Recommendations

Based on the test results, the TabPFN Cloud Function is working as expected with mock data. Before deploying to production:

1. Test with actual TabPFN API (disable mock mode)
2. Verify performance with larger datasets (100+ transactions)
3. Test integration with Google Sheets
4. Consider adding rate limiting for production use

## Next Steps

- Deploy to test environment
- Conduct end-to-end testing with Google Sheets integration
- Monitor performance metrics in cloud environment
- Create user documentation for the Google Sheets integration
